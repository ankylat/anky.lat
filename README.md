# Your Uniqueness Is a Gift

tl;dr: this repo is the pwa of anky. one of the infinite branches of expression of an interpretation of the underlying truth of all religions.

![Anky is you](https://github.com/jpfraneto/anky/tree/main/public/images/background.png?raw=true)

This is the core belief behind Anky, a brand that seeks to push the boundaries of storytelling and the use of technology as a tool for helping you embody your uniqueness.

Each Anky inside the collection has its own and unique story, belonging to one of the 8 worlds that conform the Ankyverse: Primordia, Emblazion, Chryseos, Eleasis, Voxlumis, Insightia, Claridium and Poiesis.

Anky is designed to guide its community on a path to self-realization and personal growth. Each one of these 8 kingdoms represents a different aspect of your existence:

Primordia -> Survival
Emblazion -> Passion
Chryseos -> Willpower
Eleasis -> Compassion
Voxlumis -> Communication
Insightia -> Intuition
Claridium -> Enlightenment
Poiesis -> Creativity

By being part of Anky, you are invited to delve into the rich lore, and use the story of a unique character as a mirror to your story, embarking on an enlightening journey that traverses the boundaries between the digital and physical, and even the thresholds of your consciousness.

Sojourns - Cyclical Nature of the Ankyverse

The Ankyverse comes into life in 96 day cycles, called sojourns.
The promise that jp makes, the creator of this collection, is the one of consistency over intensity. During each 96 day cycle, he will work 100 minutes every day building the app of that sojourn.

The first one starts on the 10th of August, on which the first spiritual-technological tool will begin its development: the "Writing Dementor".

This game harnesses the power of writing as a means of self-exploration. Every day you will get a new question related to your human experience, and you'll have to answer inside an app that if you stop writing for 3 seconds you lose.

This leaves no room for hesitation, it pushes you to delve deeper into your experiences and thoughts. If you think, you stop being present. What ends up coming is part of your unconscious, and the goal of this design is to integrate your unconscious experience into your present.

The challenge is to write for 8 minutes.

This game is a training ground for more fully embodied presence, and it is the mission of jp to use the platform of Anky as an interface to develop apps and experiences that practically help the community.

## I need help.
